# Importance of Virtualization in the Amazon EC2 Cloud
# In this post, I have selected the Amazon EC2 cloud service as a good use case to illustrate the importance of cloud virtualization in IaaS cloud service model.
# What is Virtualization?
 # According to Tech Target (2017), the “Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something.” (Virtualization, 2017).
 # The concept of virtualization goes back to 1960s, but it was popularized by VMWare in 1999 when it was introduced to cheap Intel® hardware, which allowed anyone to virtualize a traditional computer with all its resources. The same model eventually extended from desktops and servers to also cover the network, storage, data devices, as well applications (through app virtualization – software encapsulation from the underlying operating system).

# Virtualization and the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model
 # The Amazon IaaS cloud service model is characterized by delivering virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service. A good example of the virtualization of Amazon AWS services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is essentially an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor. 

# Conclusion
 # As we can see, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) would not exist without the virtualization which is right at the core of IaaS cloud model and the EC2 implementation at Amazon.
