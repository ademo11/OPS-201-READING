# what is an SOP
  # + A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task. Some would say that writing an SOP is both a science and an art form. There’s a lot of truth in that. I have to admit that I’ve seen a number of approaches for writing SOPs, some that I liked better than others. I’ve seen SOPs that to say were “minimalist” would be an overstatement. I’ve seen SOPs that could be considered novels. I’ve also seen the impact of poorly-written or non-existent SOPs.

# Why Are SOPs So Important?
 # + SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of an organization, but without SOPs, are not actionable. SOPs also encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets described in a service level agreement.

# Challenges in Writing SOPs
 # + One of the most significant challenges in writing SOPs is that there are no hard and fast rules for writing them. A format or writing style that works for one organization may not work as well with another organization.
 # + Secondly, SOPs can become out of date very quickly if not regularly maintained. The business is ever-changing and evolving, and as a result, IT changes and evolves as well. If SOPs aren’t maintained as part of those changes, they will become obsolete.

# Things to Consider
 # While there is no right or wrong way to write an SOP, there are several things that you must consider when writing an SOP. SOPs must be: 

# **Readable**. This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.

# **Consumable**. Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.
# **Understandable**. To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.

# **Actionable**. SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.

# **Measurable**. The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.

# A Plan for Writing an SOP
 # Just like you wouldn’t begin a journey without knowing where you were going, writing SOPs should not be done without having a plan. To develop a plan, first draw a simple flowchart to map the activities of the procedure from beginning to end. This helps form the outline and scope of the SOP as well as confirm the sequence of activities.

# Next, combine any closely-related topics so that the SOP becomes more concise and readable. For example, the flowchart may depict an activity for capturing a caller’s name, followed by an activity for capturing the caller’s contact information, followed by an activity for capturing location. These three activities could be combined under a single activity called “Capture caller information.”
