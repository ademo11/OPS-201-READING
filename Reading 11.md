# SSD Data Recovery Best Practices
   # How do I know if my SSD is failing?

# Unfortunately, SSD failures are hard to detect. Unlike HDDs, SSDs do not emit audible signals like whirring, clicking, or humming when they’re approaching a complete shutdown. SSDs can operate in silence until they simply stop functioning.

# N‑sight RMM
  # Still, SSDs do display warning signals that educated users can learn to identify. Armed with the proper knowledge, an individual may be able to detect probable SSD failure and can take steps to intervene.


# Bad blocks. All storage forms are vulnerable to flawed memory. In an SSD, this takes the form of “bad blocks”—storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions.

# If you observe any of the above symptoms in an SSD and suspect a storage drive may have bad blocks, the best course of action is to run software that searches for physical defects. If the software discovers physical damage, you’ll want to back up essential files and replace your SSD.

# File system repair. 
  # Crashing. If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing.

# How do you fix a failed SSD? 
  # How you approach fixing an SSD that is failing to perform properly depends on the source of its issues. 

# Some recovery options include:
  # Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system.
  # Power cycling the SSD. 
  # Idling in the boot menu. 
  # Updating SSD firmware. 
  # Updating drivers. 

# How to Erase a Hard Drive Using DBAN
# Download the DBAN program. To start, you have to download DBAN.
 # You can do this on the same computer you're going to erase or on an entirely different one. However you do it, the goal is to get the ISO file downloaded and then burned to a bootable device like a CD or flash drive.
 # Save the DBAN ISO file to your computer.
 # Burn DBAN to a disc or USB device
 # Restart and boot into the DBAN disc or USB device.
 # Choose an option from the DBAN main menu.
# DBAN Menu Options
 # Immediately start using DBAN with a Quick Command. Choosing F3 from DBAN's main menu will open this Quick Commands screen.
 # DBAN Commands and Data Sanitization Method
 # Choose which hard drives to wipe with Interactive Mode.
 # Wait for DBAN to erase the hard drive(s).
 # Verify DBAN has successfully erased the hard drive(s)
